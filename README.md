## chatroom
A chatroom that has enough features to use for simple conversation. (If you have more than 100 people it may not work.)
## running
# server
```
python server/server.py 0.0.0.0 5000
```
This will bind to port 5000 on current machine.
# client
```
python client/client.py <ip of server> <port of server>
```
## thanks to
Geeksforgeeks for a tuitorial.
## problems that will not be fixed
 * getting a message while typing splits input
 * blank terminal when server stops.
